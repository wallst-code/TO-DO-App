<h3>SUMMARY</h3> 
<p>This fun little project was finished in 2022. It was part of a learning project. Even though it is a simple project it contains some important web development techniques. For example, selecting and manipulating HTML elements by adding JavaScript.</p>

<p>In this particular project, the user can enter a task into the list, mark it as complete, when it is completed, and then when they are ready they can clear all completed tasks. A handy app!</p>

<p>*Note: this version is for demonstration only, and as such, no local storage or database has been created.<p>
